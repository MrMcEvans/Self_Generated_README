<h1> This is my submission for challenge six during my coding bootcamp through UT Austin.</h1>

<h3>I was tasked with adding javascript functionality along with nodejs and inquirer 
to allow a user to create a professional README with just their inputs.
These functions were adding a questions array, a block of code to collect and 
display info of the license link and image, and create a generateMarkdown function 
that will place all necessary info in the correct place.</h3>
